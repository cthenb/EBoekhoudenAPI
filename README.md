# EBoekhoudenAPI
When adding the SOAP API as a service reference to a C# .NET core application, a connection could not be established.
To avoid this issue, a simple .NET application has been created of which the NUGET can be integrated in the C# .NET core solution.

You may fork/clone/integrate/reuse this simple project as you see fit. I do not require credits.
